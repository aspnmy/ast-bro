Read structure with `ast-outline` before opening full contents. Pull method bodies only once you know which ones you need.

Stop at the step that answers the question:

1. **Unfamiliar directory** — `ast-outline digest <dir>`: one-page map of every file's types and public methods.

2. **One file's shape** — `ast-outline <file>`: signatures with line ranges, no bodies (5–10× smaller than a full read).

3. **One method, class, or markdown section** — `ast-outline show <file> <Symbol>`. Suffix matching: `TakeDamage`, or `Player.TakeDamage` when ambiguous. Multiple at once: `ast-outline show Player TakeDamage Heal Die`. For markdown, the symbol is the heading text.

4. **Who implements/extends a type** — `ast-outline implements <Type> <dir>`: AST-accurate (skip `grep`), transitive by default with `[via Parent]` tags on indirect matches. Add `--direct` for level-1 only.

5. **You don't know the file or symbol name** — `ast-outline search "<query>"`: hybrid BM25 + dense semantic search over the repo. Use bare identifiers for symbol lookup (`HandlerStack`, `Sinatra::Base` — auto-leans BM25), full sentences for behaviour search ("how does login work" — auto-balances semantic + BM25). First call builds an index at `.ast-outline/index/` (~seconds for typical repos); subsequent calls reuse it and refresh incrementally.

6. **Find code similar to a chunk you already have** — `ast-outline find-related <file>:<line>`: returns chunks semantically similar to the one containing that line. Useful for "what else looks like this?" or finding alternative implementations. Pastes directly from `search` output (which prints results as `path:start-end`).

Fall back to a full read only when you need context beyond the body `show` returned. If the outline header contains `# WARNING: N parse errors`, the outline for that file is partial — read the source directly for the affected region.
