# File filtering

`ast-outline` skips a lot of files when walking a directory — by design. This page documents exactly what gets included, what gets skipped, and how to override it. It applies uniformly to every subcommand: `outline`, `digest`, `show`, `implements`, `search`, `find-related`, and `index`.

## The five layers

Each file goes through five filter layers in order. The first to reject wins, and ast-outline never opens the file.

### 1. `.gitignore` (and friends)

ast-outline uses the [`ignore`](https://crates.io/crates/ignore) crate's `WalkBuilder`, which respects the same conventions `git` does:

- `.gitignore` at every level (root + nested directories)
- `.git/info/exclude`
- The user's global gitignore (`core.excludesfile`)
- `.ignore` files (the `ignore` crate's own convention — git itself doesn't read these, but `ripgrep`/`fd`/etc. do)
- The `.git/` directory itself

For most well-maintained repos this catches `node_modules/`, `dist/`, build outputs, etc.

### 2. Hardcoded denylist

Some repos forget to gitignore `node_modules/` (or are monorepos where it slipped through, or are vendoring deps). As a safety net, ast-outline always skips these directory names regardless of `.gitignore`:

```
.git .hg .svn .jj
__pycache__ .venv venv .tox
.mypy_cache .pytest_cache .ruff_cache
node_modules .next .nuxt .turbo .parcel-cache
dist build out .eggs target
.cache .gradle .idea .vscode
.ast-outline
```

The list is in [`src/file_filter.rs`](../src/file_filter.rs) — `HARDCODED_IGNORE_DIRS`. New entries should be:

- virtually never containing searchable user code
- huge enough to slow indexing meaningfully
- a stable, conventional name

### 3. `.ast-outline-ignore`

Per-repo escape hatch. A file at any level using gitignore syntax — handled by `ignore::WalkBuilder::add_custom_ignore_filename(".ast-outline-ignore")` so the rules are applied identically to `.gitignore` (including `!` un-ignore patterns and nested files in subdirectories).

Useful for excluding paths from ast-outline that you don't want excluded from git itself. For example:

```gitignore
# .ast-outline-ignore
tests/fixtures/large_corpus/
benches/data/
*.generated.rs
```

`tests/fixtures/large_corpus/` stays git-tracked but doesn't get walked when you outline or search the repo.

### 4. Extension allowlist (chunker)

For `search` / `find-related` / `index` only, an additional check: the file must have an extension that ast-outline can chunk structurally. The single source of truth is `chunker::is_indexable`:

- Anything `ast-grep` can parse (`.rs`, `.py`, `.pyi`, `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.js`/`.jsx`/`.mjs`/`.cjs`, `.java`, `.cs`, `.go`, `.kt`/`.kts`, `.scala`/`.sc`, `.bash`/`.sh`, `.cpp`/`.hpp`/`.c`/`.h`, `.css`, `.dart`, `.ex`/`.exs`, `.hs`, `.hcl`, `.html`, `.json`, `.lua`, `.nix`, `.php`, `.rb`, `.swift`, `.yaml`/`.yml`, `.zig`, `.sol`)
- Markdown variants (`.md`, `.markdown`, `.mdx`, `.mdown`)

Everything else (binaries, lockfiles, images, fonts, `.min.js`, `.txt`, etc.) is skipped before the file is opened.

`outline` / `digest` / `show` / `implements` use a narrower set — only the languages with a hand-written outline adapter at [`src/adapters/`](../src/adapters/) (Rust, Python, TS family, Java, C#, Go, Kotlin, Scala, Markdown). The chunker's broader set means search supports more languages than outline does. See [architecture.md](architecture.md).

### 5. File-level guards (search / index only)

Before chunking + embedding, search additionally skips files that:

- exceed `--max-file-size` (default not yet wired in v1; will land in phase 8)
- look generated/bundled by name (e.g. `*.min.js`, `*-lock.json`) — also pending wiring

These don't apply to outline-family commands.

## Debugging "why is/isn't this file included?"

Quickest path:

```bash
# What does ast-outline actually walk?
ast-outline digest path/to/dir | head

# Compare against rg's ignore-respecting walk:
rg --files path/to/dir --no-ignore-vcs   # ignore .gitignore (still skips .git)
rg --files path/to/dir                   # respects .gitignore (closest baseline)
```

If `rg --files` shows a file but `ast-outline digest` doesn't:

1. Check the extension — is it in the allowlist for the command you're running?
2. Check for `.ast-outline-ignore` files at any level.
3. Check the hardcoded denylist (some directory in the path is in `HARDCODED_IGNORE_DIRS`).

If `ast-outline` shows a file but you want it excluded:

1. Add it to `.ast-outline-ignore` (preferred — per-repo, version-controlled).
2. Or add it to `.gitignore` (also excludes from git).

## Trade-offs we've made

- **Hardcoded denylist over pure `.gitignore` reliance** — protects users with permissive `.gitignore` from accidentally indexing 1 GB of `node_modules`. Cost: a fresh repo can't index its own `node_modules` even if it wanted to (unlikely, but possible — see escape hatch below).
- **No CLI flag to disable the denylist in v1** — keeps the surface small. If you genuinely need to walk `node_modules`, point ast-outline at it directly: `ast-outline digest node_modules/some-package` (the denylist is component-based and only triggers when `node_modules` appears as an *intermediate* component).
- **Same filtering for outline + search** — one mental model. Adding an outline adapter for a new language and adding it to search both happen automatically once `is_indexable` claims the extension.
